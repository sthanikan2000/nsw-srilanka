# Applies migrations/ to PostgreSQL with the migrator version the tnsw-migrate
# image pins (`migrate` on PATH), the way deployments run it:
#   1. a fresh install: every migration into an empty database;
#   2. an upgrade: BASE's migrations applied by BASE's migrator, then each
#      migration this change adds, one at a time: applied, rolled back and
#      compared with the schema from before it, then applied again. So every
#      new migration needs a @DOWN that undoes its schema changes. BASE_MIGRATE
#      names BASE's migrator when the Dockerfile pin differs; it defaults to
#      `migrate`. Older migrations are not rolled back: several have no @DOWN
#      on purpose.
# Connection settings come from DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD and
# DB_SSLMODE (default require, as the migrator's). Schemas are compared with
# PG_DUMP (default `pg_dump`), which may be a wrapper such as a `docker exec`
# into the server's container, so the client matches the server version. The
# script creates its own databases and drops them when it ends.
#
