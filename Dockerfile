# Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM so this stage always runs natively on the machine
# doing the build, never under emulation. Go cross-compiles to the target arch
# from the GOOS/GOARCH below, so a multi-arch build reuses one native toolchain
# instead of running an emulated compiler once per platform. The --platform flag
# on a FROM line requires BuildKit (see CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Migrate builder – builds the standalone migrator from OpenNSW/agency.
# It lives in a separate module, so we fetch it inside a throwaway module rather
# than adding it to this repo's go.mod. CGO is disabled: the tool imports
# go-sqlite3, but we only drive postgres (pure-Go pgx), so sqlite stays an unused
# runtime stub. We use `go build -o` rather than `go install`, because
# `go install` refuses to write the binary when cross-compiling for a non-host
# GOOS/GOARCH (multi-arch buildx) — a constraint that now binds on every
# cross-arch target, since this stage is pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM and a
# two-platform build always has one. Do not "simplify" it back to go install.

# Bump to adopt a newer migrator (overridable via --build-arg / compose).
# This commit is release v0.3.0. The value must be a pseudo-version rather than
# `v0.3.0`: the module sits in the repo's backend/ subdirectory, so Go honours
# only a `backend/`-prefixed tag, while the release tags sit at the repo root.
# A bare `v0.3.0` resolves the root module and fails with "does not contain
# package .../backend/cmd/migrate", because backend/ is carved out of the root
# module by its own go.mod. Publishing `backend/v0.3.0` upstream would make the
# plain tag usable here.
# TARGETOS/TARGETARCH are declared here rather than at the top of the stage on
# purpose: a declared ARG enters the environment of every RUN below it, which
# makes those layers platform-specific even when they never read it. Keeping them
# down here lets `apk add git` and `go mod init` above be computed once and shared
# by every target platform. The fetch below stays fused to the build (see the
# MIGRATE_VERSION note) so it does still run per platform.
